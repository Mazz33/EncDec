# Encrypter-Decrypter

*Work in progress*

### Goals:
> Support all encryption, hashing, encodings around

### Why this?
> I am doing this project for fun / learning purposes. Plan is to write the encryption algorithms and get better at crypto and C.  
> Since I'm busy with life i barely find time to work on this so it's kind of a dead project :^).
